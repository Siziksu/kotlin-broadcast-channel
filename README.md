# Kotlin Broadcast Channel in Android

## Motivation

This project aims to show how to use the [Broadcast Channel](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.channels/-broadcast-channel/) of Kotlin.

The language used is [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/).

For the dependency injection, it uses [Koin](https://github.com/InsertKoinIO/koin).

To manage the app flow, it uses the [Navigation](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation) component.

## What it does?

- It has two views (fragments).
- You have one button to increment a value.
- When you change to another fragment, the value is updated.
